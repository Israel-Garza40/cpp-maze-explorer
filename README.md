#Project Overview
#Students will create a dynamic, text-based maze explorer using nested loops. The maze will be printed directly without arrays, and the user will navigate through it using loops and decision-making structures.
#This project will be completed in GitHub CodeSpaces, and students must submit a GitHub repository link.
